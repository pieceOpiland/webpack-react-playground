# Webpack-React-Playground

There isn't really much to this project. It's just as the repository
name suggests: a playground for working with webpack and react. I'm
just testing these technologies out, and wanted a place to put that 
work.

So far, things I've gotten working are:
* Basic React rendering
* Basic React-Router integration
* Component Hot Loading
* Server Side Rendering
* Babel Integration

I'd like to also get around to:
* Add a data store via redux
* CSS (or some preprocessor) integration
* Better Production support
* Deploy on Heroku
